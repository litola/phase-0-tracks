Use elevator 

we are assuming the range of floors is from 0-10

-for the very first time go all the way down, so we can count from zero.
-go to the called floor and
-wait for the door to open
-if 2 min pass and the closing sensor clear 
	-close the door
-otherwise 
	-wait for the time and the sensor is clear
-ask which floor they need to go
-if answer received
	-if answer < actual floor
		-start subtracting floor = floor - 1 for each floor it goes down
	-else	
		-start adding floor = floor + 1 for each floor it goes up
-floor = answer received
	-open the door in the desired floor
-else 
	-stay in the same floor
	-close door when sensor clear
-repeat
