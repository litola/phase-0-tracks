<!-- 
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	- In my understanding the semantic tags, explain the purpose of the piece of code in between and gives certain properties from the specific tag. Like header, a, p, h1- h6, div, and footer.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	- from what I researched, first the DOM is created from the info received from the server.
	- The  CSS and styles are loaded and applied.
	- the rendering tree is created are all the objects to be rendered.
	- then the layout its done.
	-and finally it displays on the browser by a process named painting. 
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	-that we can create snippets, and some extra shortcuts. For sure with more experience I get and see the patterns that dont change or change just a little I can create more usful patterns.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? 
	-they may be the difference between article, section and div. I think, with experience I will know when to use wich one in the real examples.
