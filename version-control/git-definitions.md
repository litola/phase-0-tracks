# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
version control let you store different stages of a project, so you can rollback
if something goes wrong, have 1 or more developers working in the same project,
have a working project and be making changes for the next update or version of
the project.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
a branch makes a copy of master or another branch so you can make changes, add
features or remove and at the end if everything goes as desired you can merge
them to master. It is recommended to work everything on branches and be merging
them into master after verifying it worked.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
commits are like tabs, that you make in a branch or in master so you can check
the changes that were made up until that certain point. A good name is a
description of the changes made in that commit.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict can occur when more than one developer changes the same line in
the same file, one modifies a file while the other one deletes the file. Its
changing the same part in two or more different ways, that git doesn't know
which one is the right thing and which part to ignore.
